    "\n",
    "A huge part of text analysis is your data collection - one of the initial goals of the tutorial was to walk the user through the process of cleaning messy twitter data, or scraping data off the internet. But while this does remain an integral part of text analysis, a one and half hour tutorial cannot do justice to both the process of data collection and data analysis - so we will use two more popular, already available data-sets for the purpose of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the only main difference between using a standardised data-set and scraping your own data off the internet is that internet data is largely unstructured; this means we will be spending a lot of time in organising our data into a form that is easy to pre-processes. The datasets we will be working with will be the Lee corpus which is a shortened version of the [Lee Background Corpus](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~mdlee/lee_pincombe_welsh_document.PDF), and the [20NG dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/). We will be performing different tasks with these two datasets, and will talk a little bit more about the datasets when we come across them.\n",

       "hundreds of people have been forced to vacate their homes in the southern highlands of new south wales as strong winds today pushed a huge bushfire towards the town of hill top. a new blaze near goulburn, south-west of sydney, has forced the closure of the hume highway. at about 4:00pm aedt, a marked deterioration in the weather as a storm cell moved east across the blue mountains forced authorities to make a decision to evacuate people from homes in outlying streets at hill top in the new south wales southern highlands. an estimated 500 residents have left their homes for nearby mittagong. the new south wales rural fire service says the weather conditions which caused the fire to burn in a finger formation have now eased and about 60 fire units in and around hill top are optimistic of defending all properties. as more than 100 blazes burn on new year's eve in new south wales, fire crews have been called to new fire at gunning, south of goulburn. while few details are available at this stage, fire authorities says it has closed the hume highway in both directions. meanwhile, a new fire in sydney's west is no longer threatening properties in the cranebrook area. rain has fallen in some parts of the illawarra, sydney, the hunter valley and the north coast. but the bureau of meteorology's claire richards says the rain has done little to ease any of the hundred fires still burning across the state. \"the falls have been quite isolated in those areas and generally the falls have been less than about five millimetres,\" she said. \"in some places really not significant at all, less than a millimetre, so there hasn't been much relief as far as rain is concerned. \"in fact, they've probably hampered the efforts of the firefighters more because of the wind gusts that are associated with those thunderstorms.\" \n",
       "indian security forces have shot dead eight suspected militants in a night-long encounter in southern kashmir. the shootout took place at dora village some 50 kilometers south of the kashmiri summer capital srinagar. the deaths came as pakistani police arrested more than two dozen militants from extremist groups accused of staging an attack on india's parliament. india has accused pakistan-based lashkar-e-taiba and jaish-e-mohammad of carrying out the attack on december 13 at the behest of pakistani military intelligence. military tensions have soared since the raid, with both sides massing troops along their border and trading tit-for-tat diplomatic sanctions. yesterday, pakistan announced it had arrested lashkar-e-taiba chief hafiz mohammed saeed. police in karachi say it is likely more raids will be launched against the two groups as well as other militant organisations accused of targetting india. military tensions between india and pakistan have escalated to a level not seen since their 1971 war. \n",

       "the united states team of monica seles and jan-michael gambill scored a decisive victory over unseeded france in their first hopman cup match at burswood dome in perth. the pair, runners-up in the $1 million dollar mixed teams event last year, both won their singles encounters to give the us an unbeatable 2-0 lead. the 28-year-old seles, currently ranked eighth, recovered from a shaky start to overpower virginie razzano, 18, who is ranked 72nd. seles had to fight hard to get home in straight sets, winning 6-3, 6-4 in 62 minutes. then the 24-year-old gambill (ranked 21st) wore down a determined arnaud clement, 24, (18th) to win 6-4, 6-4 in 91 minutes. the americans are aiming to go one better than last year when they were beaten by swiss pair martina hingis and roger federer in the final of the eight-nation contest. gambill said the win was a great way to start the tennis year. \"i got a little tentative at the end, but it was a great start to my year,\" he said. \"arnaud is a great scrapper and i am delighted to beat him, even though i am frankly a bit out of shape. \"that is one of the reasons i am here. i will be in shape by the end of the tournament. \"i just aim to keep improving in the new year, and if i do, i think i have a chance to beat anyone when i am playing well.\" gambill was pressed hard by clement before taking the first set in 47 minutes. but the american gained the ascendancy in the second set, breaking in the third and fifth games. seles said she had expected her clash with razzano to be tough. \"she was a top junior player in the world, so it was no surprise that she fought so well,\" she said. seles said she still had the hunger to strive to regain her position at the top of her sport. \"this is why you play,\" she said. \"but i want to try not to peak too early this season. \"seles, slow into her stride, slipped to 2-3 in her opening set against razzano but recovered quickly, claiming the set after snatching four games in a row. in the second set, seles broke her opponent in the opening game and completed victory with relative ease despite razzano's tenacious efforts. \n",

       "there has been welcome relief for firefighters in new south wales overnight with milder weather allowing them to strengthen containment lines around the most severe fires. but fire authorities are not getting overly optimistic as dry and hot weather is forecast to continue. the weather bureau is forecasting temperatures in the high 30s and westerly winds until at least friday, which means fire authorities are reluctant to get too excited about last night's favourable conditions. marks sullivan from the rural fire service says fire fighters are remaining on guard. \"a lot of fires that have been burning in the areas around sydney and the north coast and further south have been burning within areas that are known and are contained,\" he said. \"however, that's not to say that these fires won't pose a threat given the weather conditions that are coming up over the next few days.\" despite the caution, the rural fire service says most of the state's fires that threaten property are burning within containment lines. greater sydney is ringed by fires to the north, west and south. two of those flared overnight. one at appin in the southern highlands was quickly brought under control. another flare-up at spencer, north of the city, is not contained on its north-western flank, but is not threatening property. in the lower blue mountains west of sydney, firefighters have spent the night setting up a 20 kilometre containment line to protect communities along the great western highway from glenbrook to bulaburra. two fires burning near cessnock, west of newcastle, are still within containment lines. in the state's north, aircraft will this morning check if lightning from a large electrical storm overnight has sparked any new fires above grafton. aircraft have also been used in the shoalhaven area in the state's south to drop incendiary devices that start fire control lines in inaccessible areas. the rural fire service commissioner phil koperberg says if fire activity increases hundreds of new year's eve fireworks celebrations in new south wales will be cancelled. \n",
       "some roads are closed because of dangerous conditions caused by bushfire smoke. motorists are being asked to avoid the hume highway between picton road and the illawarra highway, where police have reduced the speed limit from 110 kilometres an hour to 80. in southern sydney, picton road is closed between wilton and bulli, appin road is closed from appin to bulli tops, and all access roads to royal national park are closed. motorists are also asked to avoid the illawarra highway between the hume highway and robertson, and the great western highway between penrith and springwood because of reduced visibility. in north-western sydney only local residents are allowed to use wisemans ferry road and upper color road under police escort. \n",

       "peru has entered two days of official mourning for the more than 220 people killed in a fire that's destroyed part of downtown lima. police say the fire began when a fireworks cache exploded in a shop just four blocks from peru's congress in a heritage-listed area famed for its spanish colonial-era architecture. early evening crowds buying traditional fireworks for new year's eve celebrations were trapped by the flames as they raced through surrounding markets and four-storey apartment buildings. local residents blame vendors of illegal fireworks and say the death toll was exacerbated by poor traffic control in the adjoining, narrow street where cars - themselves engulfed by fire -  trapped fleeing victims. hospitals have urged the public to donate medicine for the hundreds of burns victims. peru's president alejandro toledo has cut short his beach holiday to oversee an inquiry. \n",
       "president general pervez musharraf says pakistan wants to defuse the brewing crisis with india, but was prepared to respond vigorously to any attack. \"pakistan stands for peace, pakistan wants peace, pakistan wants to reduce tension,\" he said. \"let the two countries move towards peace and harmony. \"however, pakistan has taken all counter measures, if any war is thrust on pakistan, the pakistan armed forces and the 140 million people of pakistan are fully prepared to face all consequences with all their might.\" the president said he had received the \"support of all political parties\". president musharraf also said he welcomed the intervention of the international community in trying to defuse the potentially explosive crisis. \"we would like anybody to play a useful and positive role in defusing the tension.\" the united states, the european union and the group of eight industrialised nations among others, have all called on india and pakistan to exercise restraint and resolve the stand-off through dialogue. president musharraf repeated his offer of holding talks with indian prime minister atal behari vajpayee. \"i am for dialogue and i keep on saying this and india keeps on rejecting which gives me a feeling that i am begging to india. if they accept it we do not reject it at all,\" he said. on friday he said he was willing to meet prime minister vajpayee on the sidelines of the january 4-6 south asian association for regional cooperation (saarc) summit in nepal. india ruled out any face-to-face talks. military tensions erupted between india and pakistan after the bloody december 13 raid on the indian parliament. india accuses pakistan's military intelligence of masterminding the assault, but pakistan denies the allegation. with both countries massing troops along the border, pakistan foreign minister abdul sattar warned saturday that the dispute was growing \"dangerously  tense\" and any small act of provocation could snowball into conflict. president musharraf said one of the goals of sunday's meeting was \"to take stock of the internal situation, the domestic environment\". \"i want to eradicate militancy, extremism, intolerance from pakistani society and i also said i would like to eradicate any form of terrorism from the soil of pakistan.\" however he warned the \"tension that has mounted on our eastern border in fact is creating obstacles and hurdles\". \n",
       "talks between afghan and british officials in kabul have ended without final agreement on the deployment of a international security force. the lack of a suitable translation of the document meant a further delay. authorities in kabul have been giving conflicting signals for weeks now over the number of peacekeepers they would allow and the role the international force would play. the foreign minister, dr abdullah, appeared to be ending the confusion, saying an agreement was about to be signed. \"there is already the agreement, so it was finalised,\" he said. but a spokesman for the interior minister, yunis kanooni, emerged soon after to say there was no agreement and nothing to sign. scores of british peacekeepers are already patrolling the streets of kabul in tandem with afghan police. but proposals to enlarge the force to as many as 5,000 international peacekeepers have been criticised by some commanders as tantamount to foreign occupation. \n",
       "the israeli army has killed three palestinian militants who attacked one of its armoured vehicles in the northern gaza strip. the three palestinians opened fire with rifles at the vehicle between the jewish settlements of alei sinai and nitzanit, on the northern edge of the gaza strip. they were killed by shell fire from a tank, the sources said. during the fire fight an israeli army observation post called in tank fire which killed the three gunmen. the killing brings the death toll of 15 months of the palestinian uprising against israeli occupation to 1,121 people, including 865 palestinians and 234 israelis. alei sinai was attacked on october 2 when two gunmen from the radical islamic group hamas infiltrated the settlement and opened fire on the residents, killing two teenage israelis. two palestinian gunmen also killed an israeli settler in alei sinai on december 2 before being killed by the army. \n",

       "there is a one in 20 chance of a dramatic rise in world sea levels over the next century due to global warming, according to a new risk assessment. the survey by the british antarctic survey (bas) and norwegian environmental safety organisation det norske veritas, says there is a 5 per cent chance of the giant west antarctic ice sheet disintegrating due to climate change. scientist david vaughan says if that happens, sea levels would rise by one metre in the next 100 years. \"you have to balance the likelihood against the severity of the impacts, and in this case even a 5 per cent chance of this happening is really damn serious,\" he said. scientists have already predicted a rise in sea levels of 50 centimetres over the next century, due to a combination of climate change and increased extraction of ground water. mr vaughan says that estimate did not factor in melting antarctic ice. \"so we might be looking at something like 1.5 metres in the next century,\" mr vaughan said. mr vaughan says the possible break-up of the west antarctic ice sheet, which accounts for 13 per cent of ice on the frozen continent, is not related to the impact of human industrial activity on the climate. he says it is part of a far older process. however, he says major world polluters cannot walk away from the problem. \"the potential impacts of a major change in the west antarctic ice sheet are severe - sea level rise will be fantastically expensive for developed nations with coastal cities and dire for poor populations in low-lying coastal areas,\" mr vaughan said. \n",

       "the australian transport safety bureau has called for pilots to be better trained on the risks of air turbulence. it is a response to helicopter crash last august which claimed the life of media personality shirley strachan. mr strachan was on  a solo navigation training flight on august 29 when he crashed into mt archer on queensland's sunshine coast. witnesses told of seeing mr strachan apparently struggling to control his aircraft just prior to the crash. safety bureau director alan stray says the helicopter was struck by severe air turbulence, a phenomena known as a mountain wave. it caused one of the helicopter rotors to flap and strike the tail boom. while reluctant to attribute blame, mr stray says mountain waves are not uncommon and mr strachan could have been better advised of local weather conditions prior to the flight. he says the accident is a wake up call to flight trainers to ensure students are fully educated on the dangers of weather phenomena. the helicopter training company which owned the aircraft mr strachan died in has declined to comment in detail on the findings. blue tongue helicopters owner, helen gillies, says the company respects the findings of the australian transport safety bureau. mrs gillies says the investigation was a thorough one, but says that the incident is still too painful to discuss. the former chief financial officer of retailer harris scarfe will face court on 32 charges following inquiries by the australian securities and investment commission (asic). the charges to be faced by alan hodgson from beaumont in adelaide's eastern suburbs, include 18 counts of acting dishonestly as an officer of harris scarfe, six counts of acting dishonestly as an employee of the company and eight counts of giving false information to the australian stock exchange. the matter has been brought by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions following asic's investigation of the company. the original harris scarfe business went into receivership in april with debts of about $160 million. a management buyout by executives not connected with the original company was finalised last month. the buyout saw the closure of 12 stores around australia and the retention of 23 others in south australia, victoria and tasmania. \n",
       "the coroner investigating the death of a race marshal at the 2001 australian formula one grand prix in melbourne, has indicated he will not stand in the way of next year's race. on the last day of hearings into the death of race marshall graham beveridge, the grand prix corporation's legal team sought judicial assurance next year's event would be able to go ahead. coroner graeme johnston said his recommendations were unlikely to alter the corporation's plans for the 2002 race and they would include nothing that could not reasonably be dealt with before the forthcoming race. ross ray qc, representing the grand prix corporation and the australian confederation of motor sports, outlined plans to increase the height of debris fences and seek safety assessments from independent experts. up to 5,000 soldiers will be deployed in afghanistan later this month as an international force to provide security for the country's interim government, which is scheduled to take power this weekend. british defence secretary geoff hoon says up to 1,500 british troops will lead the force, which will begin its deployment from december 28. named the international security assistance force, it will be based in the capital, kabul, and it is expected to be there for at least three months. announcing the british deployment, mr hoon said with the current tensions in afghanistan, it will be a difficult and sometimes dangerous mission. an advance unit of 100 british marines will be in the country by the weekend with the united nations expected to mandate the force before then. australian involvement in the peacekeeping operation in afghanistan is to be determined by britain. australia has offered to take part in the force, but british defence sources have not revealed the nature of canberra's offer. the sources say britain has received too many offers for light infantry, but not enough for engineering, mine-clearing, and other logistical needs. meanwhile,  afghan forces have begun handing over captured al qaeda fighters to a new interrogation centre at the us military base of camp rhino in southern afghanistan. the numbers are likely to swell as the hunt continues for al qaeda loyalists fleeing toward pakistan. fifteen foreign fighters, captured near the northern city of mazar-e-sharif, have now been transferred to the interrogation centre at the us marine base outside kandahar. another five prisoners, including the australian, david hicks, are being held offshore on a us military ship. anti-taliban forces are continuing search for some 500 al qaeda fighters, believed to be still at large in the mountains around tora bora near the pakistan border. local commanders said they had captured 40 foreign fighters over the past few days and were holding them at the nearby city of jalalabad, pending orders from kabul. a b-52 bomber circled tora bora throughout the morning, but no air strikes were launched. \n",

       "anti-child abuse groups are calling on australia's governor-general to resign or explain to a full senate inquiry how he handled claims of alleged sexual abuse at a queensland anglican school. dr peter hollingworth has released a statement responding to claims he failed to act on abuse at the toowoomba school in 1990 when he was the anglican archbishop. in a three-page statement, dr hollingworth says he could no longer stand by and allow completely unfounded allegations to be made about him. he says at the time of the alleged abuse, legal obligations played heavily in his decision not to intervene personally. the governor-general says he relied on advice from church officials at the time, who told him not to intervene because it would jeopardise the church's insurance policy. hetty johnston, from the people's alliance against child sexual abuse, says the governor generals version of events is hard to believe. \"if dr hollingworth denies these allegations and refutes them, the voracity of those people who have made these allegations against him need to be tested in a senate inquiry because there is a lot evidence that disputes the voracity of the statements made by dr hollingworth,\" ms johnston said. queensland premier peter beattie says while the governor-general has faced serious criticism about his sensitivity in the situation, legal and insurance considerations are a sad reality. \"the governor-general's comment that the issue would have been approached differently and better, now might seem hollow to those involved, but he must be given credit now for having issued [a] statement. \"i am sure that armed with the wisdom of hindsight, the issue would have been better handled,\" mr beattie said. \n",

       "australian cricket captain steve waugh has supported fast bowler brett lee after criticism of his intimidatory bowling to the south african tailenders in the first test in adelaide. earlier this month, lee was fined for giving new zealand tailender shane bond an unsportsmanlike send-off during the third test in perth. waugh says tailenders should not be protected from short-pitched bowling. \"these days you're earning big money, you've got a responsibility to learn how to bat,\" he said. \"i mean there's no times like 20 years ago when it was not professional and sort of a bowlers' code. \"these days you're professional, our batsmen work very hard at their batting and expect other tailenders to do likewise.\" meanwhile, waugh says his side will need to guard against complacency after convincingly winning the first test by 246 runs. waugh says despite the dominance of his side in the first test, south africa can never be taken lightly. \"it's only one test match out of three, or six whichever way you want to look at it, so there's a lot of work to go,\" he said. \"but it's nice to win the first battle definitely, it gives us a lot of confidence going into melbourne, you know, the big crowd there, we love playing in front of the boxing day crowd, so that will be to our advantage as well.\" south africa begins a four-day match against new south wales in sydney on thursday in the lead up to the boxing day test. veteran fast bowler allan donald will play in the warm-up match and is likely to take his place in the team for the second test. south african captain shaun pollock expects a much better performance from his side in the melbourne test. \"we still believe that we didn't play to our full potential, so if we can improve on our aspects...the output we put out on the field will be a lot better and we still believe we have a side that is good enough to beat australia on our day,\" he said. \n",

       "interest rates and economic growth take centre stage for australian financial markets today. a rates cut is still expected despite what is thought to be a respectable set of national accounts. the australian economy has been held up as one of the few to be still ticking over well, while so many others around  the world are in recession or slowing sharply. today's national accounts for the september quarter will be the definitive measure. sg australia chief economist glenn maguire says he expects a quarterly figure of just under 1 per cent. \"if we do see economic growth up around 0.9 per cent, which is the market consensus, that is actually a relatively very good outcome,\" he said. that would translate to an annual growth rate of 2 per cent. mr maguire says domestic economic activity remains centred on the housing sector. \"i think the national accounts will reveal that the bulk of economic growth is being driven by the housing sector and those areas which are related to the housing sector, such as retail trade and manufacturing.\" but he says some areas of weakness are emerging. \"company profits were quite soft. \"also average earnings are likely to post a softer footing over the quarter as well, so looking forward, softer incomes, probably softer production as well suggest that the domestic economy will be slowing as we move into 2002,\" mr maguire said. financial markets are also waiting on a possible announcement from the reserve bank after its board meeting of yesterday. there is a high level of expectation that rates will be cut by 0.25 per cent. the australian trade commission says there are signs of recovery on global markets three months after the september 11 terrorist attacks. senior austrade staff from across the globe are in adelaide to discuss the impact of the attack on the us and  major international markets. austrade's executive general manager roger bayliss says the vast majority of global equity markets have bounced back and growth is expected to return by the third quarter of next year. mr bayliss says while there are serious challenges ahead, australian firms should not retreat. \"the most important point is to really study your markets. \"get good advice, make sure you're looking after your customers well, and certainly not staying in your shell, or in your cocoon, and adopting a very aggressive approach to overseas marketing,\" mr bayliss said. \n",
       "the labor party is set to have a wide-ranging review of its structures, with frontbencher martin ferguson pushing for the process. the new labor leader, simon crean, is taking a set of proposals to next thursday's national executive meeting. mr ferguson wants the meeting to call a review. he says suggestions for party changes, such as the call by frontbencher joel fitzgibbon for the scrapping of a new south wales rule forcing labor members to belong to a union, should be dealt with internally. \"perhaps the time has come for us to actually sign up to a federal executive process which actually enables debate to go forward in a highly constructive way rather than individual proposals being put out there without an end game in sight,\" mr ferguson said. he says he is happy for the process to include looking at abandoning the 60-40 rule, but says scrapping the rule would only be a minor factor in the party's self-examination. \"for a long time i've believed there is a requirement for the labor party to actually have a hard look at whether or not an archaic formula of union representation is the key to our future.\" \n",

       "israeli forces have launched attacks on some of the key palestinian symbols of autonomy, including gaza international airport. the strikes come as israeli authorities announced they were stepping up military operations against yasser arafat's palestinian authority. the palestinian leadership, meanwhile, appealed for intervention from the united nations security council after israeli air strikes yesterday and accused israeli prime minister ariel sharon of declaring war on the palestinians. mr sharon's government also placed force-17, the armed group in charge of mr arafat's protection, and the tanzim military groups of his fatah faction on its list of terrorist organisations, a senior israeli official said. the decisions were taken in a five-hour marathon late-night session of the national unity government, said the official, who asked not to be named. in a series of incursions and air strikes, the israeli military targeted mr arafat's symbols of power, after holding him to account for a spate of deadly suicide bombings by palestinian islamic militants. the israeli army carried out reprisal attacks against targets in the gaza strip and west bank. israeli tanks advanced to about 500 metres from mr arafat's offices in the west bank town of ramallah, witnesses and palestinian security officials said. in the gaza strip, israeli forces penetrated the airport mr arafat uses for his travels abroad and started to churn up the only runway, a palestinian liaison official said. mr sharon, blaming mr arafat for the weekend suicide bombings that killed 25 israelis, earlier sent his airforce to blast the palestinian leader's heliport in gaza and offices in the west bank town of jenin. the radical islamic movement, hamas, claimed responsibility for the suicide attacks. shortly after apache combat helicopters struck gaza city and f-16 fighter bombers hit jenin, sharon made a hard-hitting televised address, telling israelis a \"war of terrorism\" had been foisted on the jewish state. \"in choosing to try to win political accomplishments through murder and in choosing to allow the ruthless killing of civilians, arafat has chosen the path of terrorism,\" mr sharon said. \"arafat is the greatest obstacle to peace and stability in the middle east,\" mr sharon charged. \n",

       "around 1,000 people have braved the cold for a vigil in the hometown of former beatle george harrison, who died last week. \"tonight we are gathered here in memory of george harrison, a true son of liverpool, whose music reached out to the whole world and shaped a generation,\"  lord mayor gerry scott said. plans for a candlelight vigil had to be scrapped due to fierce northern winds, and harrison was honoured instead by dozens of pictures of the guitar hero, who died of cancer at age 58. after a minute's silence the crowd heard a recording of \"my sweet lord,\" harrison's biggest solo hit after the break-up of liverpool's fab four, the most famous rock group in history. harrison's family requested a second minute of silence to be held at 9:30pm local time. \"we felt we had to come tonight because losing george is like losing one of the family,\" said elsie may, who joined the throng in paying tribute to the beatle known as the silent one. \"his music shaped our lives, and in the past we would take our children to see the beatles when they were passing in a cavalcade. he was a wonderful man,\"  she said. leanne mccormack, a university student, said: \"george was a talented musician and his music touched the lives of millions of people. \"i wanted to come here tonight to pay my respects because he was such a talented man. i feel lucky to have been staying in liverpool when he died as it  has been really moving to see all the different memorials.\" just before the ceremony, students from harrison's school, dovedales juniors, planted a tree in his memory close to another tree planted two years ago in memory of john lennon, another beatle gunned down by a crazed fan in 1980. \n",
       "australian cricket coach john buchanan says his team will be going into the final day of the series deciding third test against new zealand in perth aiming to win the game. australia will resume at 2 for 69 after being set 440 to win. matthew hayden is on 31 and mark waugh eight after justin langer was dismissed for a duck and ricky ponting 26. buchanan says the outcome of the first session will determine whether australia continues to pursue victory. \"hopefully we get through that without too much damage to our upper order,\" he said. \"lunchtime i think will be a good time to reassess where the game actually stands.\" meanwhile australian fast bowler brett lee faces a possible ban after being charged over alleged misconduct during day four of the  match. lee faced a disciplinary hearing last night over an incident where he twice pointed new zealand tailender shane bond towards the dressing room after bowling him. he also allegedly used abusive language towards the kiwi number 10 batsman. south african match referee jackie hendriks will announce his verdict before play begins today. \n",

       "france is celebrating victory over australia in the davis cup tennis final, after nicholas escude defeated wayne arthurs in four sets in the deciding rubber yesterday. pat rafter was forced to withdraw from the match with a recurring arm injury just hours before he was to take the court. the deciding rubber was to be rafter's farewell match before taking an indefinite break from the sport. arthurs, who has not played a singles match since october, says he was bitterly disappointed to lose. \"any tennis players dream to be out there in front of a partisan australain crowd. you couldn't ask for anything more in your tennis career and i'm just unbelievably disappointed i didn't get the job done,\" he said. team captain john fitzgerald has defended the decision to play rafter in the doubles on saturday, saying he was always in doubt for the final match. \"there was no guarantee he could have played. i tell you anyone with less character wouldn't have lasted nearly as long. \"there was no guarantee he could play the doubles to start with, let alone the singles and if he had a day off there was still no guarantee.\" rafter failed to show up to the post-match media conference. team officals said he was tired, however todd woodbridge hit out at the media for wanting to ask him about his future plans. \"it's been [asked] 55 times every day for two and a half weeks, i mean what do you want him to say?\" he asked reporters. french team captain guy forget says the victory in part makes up for france's defeat against australia in nice two years ago. \"you're back in australia against a better team on grass, against the number one player in the world and you pull off a win, it's very, very exciting and the way it happened is just very, very special,\" he said. escude says winning the match for france is the highlight of his career. the palestinian authority has launched a crackdown on islamic militants arresting more than 70 members of the islamic jihad and hamas groups in the wake of a weekend of deadly bomb attacks against israel. the israeli government is warning of a harsh response to the attacks, the latest in the coastal city of haifa. a lone suicide bomber boarded a bus in the northern israeli town and detonated a device that killed 15 israeli passengers, some of them blown clear of the wreckage. that attack came just 12 hours after a triple bombing in jerusalem which killed 10 young israelis. several israeli government ministers suggested that yasser arafat and the palestinian leadership should now be toppled. a decision on a military response is likely to be made later today when israeli prime minister, ariel sharon, returns from the united states. after the white house demanded action, the palestinian authority has declared a state of emergency and launched late night raids to arrest scores of hamas and islamic jihad members in the west bank and gaza strip. \n",
