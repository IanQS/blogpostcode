# Purpose

1) Give you an idea of how to use TF to launch a translation startup

2) Serve as a place for me to test and play with translation models in a unified manner

3) portfolio ;) ? 

# Tf Production


## Why Tensorflow? 

Tensorflow is extremely useful in that you can use it to create an entire pipeline. You can scale up by modularizing everything, or by pushing everything to Google Cloud Platform

So, to some extent, you as an ML Engineer/ Researcher have more to do with Tensorflow, BUT you don't exactly need to rush to hire a SWE or Data Engineer to scale up


## Tensorflow Serving

Although it seems like more work than using something like PyTorch, or even native Keras, I strongly believe that the portability of Tensorflow alone makes it the best choice. Also, with Tensorflow 2.0 coming out soon it'll make it all worthwhile


# Playground

## Motivation

I enjoy testing out new ideas, and working on exciting problems. I DON'T enjoy messy code, and oftentimes testing new ideas, and having clean code are at odds with one another. If I can create a good interface, it should be entirely possible for me to have production-quality code while also being able to come in and implement something in the Models folder and run it immediately.


# Portfolio

There are SO MANY ideas that I'm interested in that it just makes sense for me to create a public repo that I can demonstrate all of it in. I'm interested in RL, NLP and Translation tasks, Geometric DL
